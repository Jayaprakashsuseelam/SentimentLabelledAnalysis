# Sentiment Labelled Analysis

This project performs sentiment analysis on three labelled datasets: `amazon_cells_labelled`, `imdb_labelled`, and `yelp_labelled`. The goal is to classify text data into positive or negative sentiment categories using NLP techniques and machine learning models.

## Datasets
The following datasets are used in this project:
1. **Amazon Customer Reviews** (`amazon_cells_labelled.txt`): Contains product reviews labelled as positive (1) or negative (0).
2. **IMDB Movie Reviews** (`imdb_labelled.txt`): Contains movie reviews labelled as positive (1) or negative (0).
3. **Yelp Restaurant Reviews** (`yelp_labelled.txt`): Contains restaurant reviews labelled as positive (1) or negative (0).

Each dataset consists of two columns:
- **Text**: The review or comment.
- **Label**: The sentiment label (0 for negative, 1 for positive).
